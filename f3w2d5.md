### Describe the term Single Page Application and why it has become so popular for modern web-applications
Single page applications receive a single page and additional assets from the server after the very first request, and on all other requests the JavaScript code fetches small pieces of data from the server and re-renders the same, already existing page instead of fetching an entirely new html page + assets again. The result of this is a fast application that never reloads during navigation since there is only one page whose DOM gets updated on the run. This improved user experience combined with a decoupled frontend (as a front-end developer you only need to know the API that you fetch from) is the primary reason that SPA’s have become so popular for modern web-applications.

### Explain the “recommended” React way of passing data into Components (at the top, or at the bottom or..)

Data is passed into components through the props parameter which is immutable. The flow only goes one way (down). State can still be lifted if a set-state function, which is defined in the mother component, is passed to the child component.

### Explain how JavaScript array methods, like filter, map and (reduce) can be used to generate dynamic HTML structures (tables, ul's etc.)

If a state object is displayed in some HTML structure, the array methods can be used to dynamically change this structure, since the structure depends on the state object – when the state changes, the list or table will change as well, since the page re-renders on every state change. This is effective for small amounts of data, but can be a demanding operation if there is a lot of data that needs to be displayed.

### Explain about the Observer pattern, and where you have used it, both with Java and JavaScript.

The Observer pattern consists of an observer and a subject. When the subject’s state changes the observers are notified of the state change and adapts to the change. In React this is exactly what happens when a state object which is displayed in some structure gets updated since every state update causes the DOM to re-render causing the displayed state object to change.
